## Notes for the short lecture on the Huygen-Fresnel principle

Huygens-Fresnel principle states that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points interfere. 

We will simplify the discussion by assuming the following:
- do not specify the scalar/vector/tensor nature of the wave, but for simplicity choose to describe it using the first option,
- do not consider actual boundary conditions, other than the continuity of the field at each point of the boundary.

What do we mean by a *spherical wavelet*? a function of the form:
$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\cos(-\omega t + |\mathbf{k}| |\mathbf{r}| + \phi(\mathbf{r})}{k|\mathbf{r}|},
\end{equation} 
$$
i.e. a function oscillating in time with frequency $\omega/2\pi$, quasi-periodic along the radial direction with the spatial period of $2\pi/|\mathbf{k}|$, and decaying from the source --- meaning that the spherical wave will not carry any information about the direction of the incident beam! We could be a bit more precise, and say that for a wave originating from point $\mathbf{r}_0$, the wavelet is given by
$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E(|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0|, t) = \frac{\cos(-\omega t + |\mathbf{k}| |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0| + \phi(\mathbf{r})}{k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0|},
\end{equation} 
$$
where we explicitly noted that function $E$ depends only on the *distance* between point of observation $\mathbf{r}$, and wave's origin $\mathbf{r}$_0.

Here's a little animation, showing how a plane wave 
$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E_\text{inc}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \cos(-\omega t + \mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r},
\end{equation} 
$$
impinging on an obstacle with aperture (red dot) will be transmitted in the form of a spherical wavelet. Note that we chose to ommit the reflection off the obstacle for clarity, and assume that both sides of the obstacle are made up of an idenfical medium.

The *phase* $\phi$ of this wavelet is chosen to match the phase of the incident beam at the wavelet's origin $\mathbf{r}_0$ --- this is an implicit assumption of the Huygens-Fresnel principle. We noted earlier that this wave clearly doesn't carry any information about the incidence angle. As it turns, out, this information becomes encoded in the phase $\phi(\mathbf{r}_0)$. 

How is that possible? Another animation might help, in which we poke more and more holes in our obstable, until we arrive at the system which is effectively more holes than an obstable. In this limiting case, we expect that the incident beam will be simply transmitted, i.e. the refracted beam, made up of spherical wavelets, will become indistinguishable from the incident plane wave:

Python code for generating the above animations is available on my [github](https://github.com/mkschmidtjr)
