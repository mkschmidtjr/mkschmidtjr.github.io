## Notes for the short lecture on the Huygen-Fresnel principle

Here's the best explanation I found (from Born&Wolf's *Principles of Optics*):

> According to Huygens construction, every point of a wave-front may be considered as a centre of a secondary disturbance which gives rise to spherical wavelets, and the wave-front at any later instant may be regarded as the envelope of these wavelets. Fresnel [...] supplemented Huygens' contribution with the postulate that the secondary wavelets mutually interfere.

We will simplify the discussion by assuming the following:
- do not specify the scalar/vector/tensor nature of the wave, but for simplicity choose to describe it using scalar formulation - imagine, for example, the local height of the water wave in your bathtub,
- do not consider actual boundary conditions, other than the continuity of the field at each point of the boundary.

What do we mean by a *spherical wavelet*? a function of the form:

$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\cos(-\omega t + |\mathbf{k}| |\mathbf{r}| + \phi(\mathbf{r}))}{k|\mathbf{r}|},
\end{equation} 
$$

i.e. a function oscillating in time with frequency $\omega/2\pi$, quasi-periodic along the radial direction with the spatial period of $2\pi k$, and decaying from the source --- meaning that the *spherical wave will not carry any information about the direction of the incident beam*! We could be a bit more precise, and say that for a wave originating from point $\mathbf{r}_0$, the wavelet is given as

$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\cos(-\omega t + |\mathbf{k}| |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0| + \phi(\mathbf{r}_0))}{k|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0|}.
\end{equation} 
$$

We note that function $E$ depends only on the *distance* between point of observation $\mathbf{r}$, and wave's origin $\mathbf{r}_0$. Function $\phi(\mathbf{r}_0)$ is there to ensure the continuity of phase between the two media.

### Transmission between identical media

Let's assume that the two sides of the obstacle have the same materials properties, i.e. the obstacle in the bathtub separates two identical bodies of water, with identical dispersion. Here's a little animation, showing how a plane wave 

$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E_\text{inc}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \cos(-\omega t + \mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}),
\end{equation} 
$$

impinging on an obstacle with aperture (red dot) will be transmitted in the form of a spherical wavelet. Note that we chose to ommit the reflection off the obstacle for clarity, and assume that both sides of the obstacle are made up of an idenfical medium.

The *phase* $\phi$ of this wavelet is chosen to match the phase of the incident beam at the wavelet's origin $\mathbf{r}_0$ --- this is an implicit assumption of the Huygens-Fresnel principle. We noted earlier that this wave clearly doesn't carry any information about the incidence angle. As it turns, out, this information becomes encoded in the phase $\phi(\mathbf{r}_0)$. 

How is that possible? Another animation might help, in which we poke more and more holes in our obstacle (marked again with red dots), until we arrive at the system which is effectively more holes than an obstacle. In this limiting case, we expect that the incident beam will be simply transmitted, i.e. the refracted beam, made up of spherical wavelets, will become an continuation of the incident plane wave:

What we find is the *core* of the Huygens-Fresnel principle --- the wavelets encode the information about the wave that generates them in the phase, and interfere, re-establishing the phase information into the constructive interference, and the amplitude, of the transmitted wave. 

We also find that the wave appears to be decaying away from the interface. That is a numerical effect, due to the fact that the sources were chosen only along the finite segment of the interface. Unfortunately, series $n^{-1}$ converges slowly. Our form of the wavelets is also a bit iffy, since it should be identically 0 on the boundary.

### Refraction between different media

Does this principle hold in a less trivial case, of wave refracting between two different materials? Note that, for the sake of this discussion, we will characterise the wave properties of the two materials only by their dispersion, i.e. the relationship between the velocities (or, equivalently, wavenumbers), and frequency. For the two materials we get

$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  \text{medium 1:}~\omega=v\cdot k,\quad \text{medium 2:}~\omega=v'\cdot k'.
\end{equation} 
$$

Imagine e.g. that our bathtub is a bit asymmetric, and the side towards which the waves hurdle is much shallower, and thus supports waves propagating substantially slower. This means that $k'$ will be substantially larger, and the spacing between the crests of the transmitted wave - smaller. It's a lot like the propagation of light beams from air to glass, or water, where light propagates approximatelky 1.3, and 1.5 times slower, respectively.

Here are two animations showing, as before, the transmission through a single aperture, and an increasingly dense mesh of apertures:

Low and behold, we again recover planewaves in the transmitted light, and the seem to be refracting in the right direction.

From here, we could too recover the Snell's law. And we would too realise that unless there's some extra effect (like a negative velocity in one of the media), we can never bend the beam backwards, i.e. as along as $v_1,v_2>0$, then $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ will have the same sign. Is there anything else we can try?

### Huygens metasurfaces

There is indeed! Remember when I defined function $\phi(\mathbf{r}_0)$, saying it is there to ensure the continuity of phase between the two media? Well, what if I had a way to locally add a little bit of phase to each spherical wave? For example, if I were to modify function $\phi(\mathbf{r}_0)$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\mathbf{r}_0) \rightarrow \phi(\mathbf{r}_0) + \alpha \frac{[\mathbf{r}_0]_x}{\lambda_0}.
\end{equation}
$$

Here's what we would get

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://mkschmidtjr.github.io/images/time_meta1.gif" width="300" />
  <img src="https://mkschmidtjr.github.io/images/time_meta2.gif" width="300" />
  <img src="https://mkschmidtjr.github.io/images/time_meta3.gif" width="300" />
</p>

In the first plot, we put $\alpha=0$ (no additional phase), and mark the phasefronts and wavevectors of the incident and transmitted waves. In the other two plots, we consider increased $\alpha$, while keeping the markings for the $\alpha=0$ for reference. In the second plot the refraction appears to be much stronger, and finally - in the first plot - **we end up bending the waves backwards**!

Note that all this is done without modifying the bulk properties of the materials, but only engineering the phase of the transmitted wave.
