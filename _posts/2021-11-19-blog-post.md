## Notes for the short lecture on the Huygen-Fresnel principle

Huygens-Fresnel principle states that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points interfere. 

We will simplify the discussion by assuming the following:
- do not specify the scalar/vector/tensor nature of the wave, but for simplicity choose to describe it using the first option,
- do not consider actual boundary conditions, other than the continuity of the field at each point of the boundary.

What do we mean by a *spherical wavelet*? a function of the form:
$$ 
\begin{equation} 
  E(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\cos(-\omega t + k |\mathbf{r}|)}{k|\mathbf{r}|},
\end{equation} 
$$
i.e. a function oscillating in time with frequency $\omega/2\pi$, quasi-periodic along the radial direction with the spatial period of $2\pi/k$, and decaying from the source. Here's a little animation, showing how a wave impinging on an obstacle with aperture will be transmitted in the form of a spherical wavelet. Note that we chose to ommit the reflection off the obstacle for clariyy.

Python code for generating the above animations is available on my [github](https://github.com/mkschmidtjr)
